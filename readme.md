Version 2.0 Requires hyperlink_manager to run.
Version 1.0 still runs in console only.


Instructions:
*** if files have been deleted outside of the program, delete _cache.json for proper file comparison
1) Place duplicate_finder.py/duplicate_gui.py outside the images folder you want to check for duplicates in.
2) Run duplicate_finder.

Notes:
Duplicate_finder will create a _cache.json in every folder that contains all relevant info to
speed the duplicate search the next time its ran.

Version notes:
1.0: basic program that searches and deletes duplicates
2.0: Added GUI, ability to view and choose images to delete.

Coming soon:
2.1: a _cache updater if you delete files in the folder outside of the program.
