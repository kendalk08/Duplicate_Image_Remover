Instructions:
*** if files have been deleted outside of the program, delete _cache.json for proper file comparison
1) Place duplicate_finder.py outside the images folder you want to check for duplicates in.
2) Run duplicate_finder.

Notes:
Duplicate_finder will create a _cache.json in every folder that contains all relevant info to
speed the duplicate search the next time its ran.

Version notes:
1.0: basic program that searches and deletes duplicates

Coming soon:
1.1: a _cache updater if you delete files in the folder outside of the program.
